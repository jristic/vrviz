Vib Ribbon score visualizer.

I wrote this as a tool to translate to and from the score display format used in Vib Ribbon.

Uses ImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and stb (https://github.com/nothings/stb). They're both pretty sweet. Check them out.

I got render to texture code from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/, whose code is provided under the WTFPL (http://www.wtfpl.net/).
